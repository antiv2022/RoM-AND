			At 100, if the unit performing the volley has the same effective strength as the victim, then the victim would suffer 1/3 of its max health.
			Higher value means more damage (can be considered a percentage), at 25 the damage would be about 1/12 of its max health.
			Example values above assumes the unit doing the volley has "iVolleyEfficiency = 100", iVolleyEfficiency is the unit specific version of this global define.
			If victim is relatively stronger to the unit performing the volley then it will take less damage, and vice versa.
			Defense modifiers reduce damage dealt to a unit by a volley, but base strength is more significant than the adjusted strength from defense modifiers.
			e.g. a unit with 10 strength and no defense modifiers will be protected slightly more from volley than a strength 5 unit with 100% defense modifier.

		<!-- AI Gold Slider Safety Percent
			This is the BASE income to expense ratio that the AI feels comfortable with.
			e.g. a value of 10 would mean that the AI feels confortable if their net income is only 10% of gross income.
				This does not mean it will always feel unconfortable if net income is less, it is just a general baseline.
				It considers how much net income it could potentially have if it reduced resarch or other non-gold commerce sliders.
			It noteworthily affects how much tolerance the AI has where it feels ready to grow.
			Increase to make the AI more sensitive to gold concerns and reduce for more reckless behavior.
			This may be rather interesting to convert to an AI personality matter or at least give a personality based modifier eventually
